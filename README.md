# hello-world
My first Github repository

Hello, my name is Joel! I'm looking forward to learning more about Git.
I'm excited to see what this community will teach me.

I'm an aerospace engineering major looking to broaden his horizons.
I have two dogs: a pitbull name Dolce (today is her birthday), and a pom-chi Seto (yes, like Kaiba).

The way to my heart is food, primarily Mexican, Italian, sushi, and of course, Skittles!
